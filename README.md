# QR-Code-generator
This is a qr code generator created by following instructions in Thonky QRcode tutorial: https://www.thonky.com/qr-code-tutorial/

It was done as a side project just to play around with the idea of QR codes, it supports numeric, alphanumeric and bit modes. Versions 1 to 5, ECC level = L.

The project is unfinished, as I'm still trying to figure out the problem of left over data modules in QR Code.
